### Selected Accomplishments:

***Design Related:***

-   Applications Engineer for Freescale’s latest dual PowerPC core (QorIQ) based SoCs. The primary end markets of this SoC are printing, digital signage and NAS applications. Am personally responsible for the Hardware Specifications, Design Guidelines and Customer support for all (Hardware and Software) issues. (FSL)
-   Led a team in the design and development of a low power, small footprint, 3-axis digital accelerometer SoC (the first product of the Xtrinsic family) which has a ColdFire Processor, Flash, ROM and RAM memories with associated controllers, multiple timers, I2C/SPI slave interface and other peripherals. I own and am responsible for all aspects of the digital design and verification, integration with analog as well as applications suite development. (FSL)
-   Led a team of 7 engineers for the architecture, design and development of a Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI) SLIMbus standard interface IP. Was personally responsible for the Timing Control Unit and the Clock and Reset Units. (FSL)
-   Participated in architecting and designing a DigRF3G standard interface IP for use with Freescale’s Mobile Handset Baseband ICs. Was personally responsible for designing the Framer, Memory interface and PISO controller. Also had joint responsibility of the synthesis effort. (FSL)
-   Led the frontend effort for two derivatives of TI’s DSP memory subsystem based on the award winning C55x DSP IP. Personally responsible for designing the cache subsystem. (TI)
-   Independently designed, coded and verified an OFDM tone modulator, for HomePlug2.0 candidate VIPER ASIC. (Cogency) 
-   Independently designed, coded and verified the USB interface of HomePlug1.0 compatible PHANTOM ASIC. USB core was integrated as an IP. PHANTOM SoC silicon was proven on reference design. (Cogency)
-   Led a team and participated in the architecture definition and coding of a USB/PCI based ADSL modem. Architected the USB controller and the USB/ADSL interface. (STM)
-   Designed, developed and verified a (2,1/2) viterbi decoder. Implemented on Xilinx Virtex, Altera Flex10K and ASIC libraries to provide benchmarking. (STM)

***Methodologies related:***

-   Modeled, implemented and verified a cache coherence protocol using BlueSpec SystemVerilog. Did comparative studies with respect to hand written RTL for lines of code, performance and area on ASIC library. (Interra)
-   Performed FPGA validation of SLIMbus IP on Altera and Xilinx devices using host interface to Nios II and ARM7 processors respectively. The Nios II and ARM processors were implemented on FPGAs and interfaced with the SLIMbus IP then validated to work on reference boards purchased after analysis from the FPGA vendors. (FSL)
-   Led a team of 12 engineers in the partitioning, mapping and verification of the Instruction Unit, Bus Interface Unit and Floating Point unit of a pentium class microprocessor on Lucent’s ORCA 3 series FPGAs. (STM)
-   Active member of IPDesign Core Team, which is a global, multi-site grouping of people mandated with improving the quality and reusability of IP developed by Freescale’s design centers located across the world. Had primary ownership of the “memory policy” and the “RTL Compiler policy”. (FSL)
-   Guided and mentored an effort to develop a serial protocol analyzer using the graphical and scripting capabilities for Tcl/Tk. Attempted to make the protocol analyzer as generic as possible but the effort was specifically targeted towards the SLIMbus protocol. (FSL)
-   Was solely responsible for consultative development and deployment of various power reduction techniques during frontend design. Techniques included isolation with multiple power domains, multi-VT and aggressive clock gating. (TI)
-   Made the testbench for DFT for the PHANTOM ASIC. ARM DFT vectors were ported for which scripts were written in perl and gawk. (Cogency)
-   Developed methodology for measurement of BlueSpec SystemVerilog RTL generation capabilities, specifically as regards synthesis by Design Compiler. (Interra)
-   Developed and generated bitstreams for designs to be used with a handcrafted semi-custom softmodel of a new FPGA architecture, developed under my guidance. This enabled swift decision making on architectural features to be incorporated in the FPGA. (STM)
-   Led and participated in the evaluation of FPGA Toolset and Architecture under development by Software Group. Gave competitive information on Toolsets of competitors (Xilinx and Altera) and provided suggestions for improvement. Benchmarked performance and area requirements against competitor devices. Arranged for the benchmark designs and developed comparison methodology. (STM)
