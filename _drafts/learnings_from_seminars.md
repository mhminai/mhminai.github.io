These are a collection of notes that I have made while attending seminars in which academics present their research for judgement by their senior colleagues. These included "Proposal seminars", "Pre-thesis seminars" and "Faculty recruitment seminars". The passage below is written from the notes I took during these seminars and are thus completely subject to my subjective interpretations of the dynamics that I felt developing during these seminars.

### First explain why there is a gap?

### Define your terms very carefully and completely

### Give specific examples to support your conclusions

### Study reverse situations as well

- Success due to presence of A -> Does absence of A imply failure? Give examples.

### Justification of inferences, particularly for qualitative research

### Encourage questions, allow questions to complete, understand the questions and then answer

### Answer the following questions in your presentation

- What is important?
- What is new?
- What is non-obvious?

### Pure qualitative research needs very very solid theoretical backing

### Always use external data to validate your inferences from case studies

### Try to get access to documents if you do qualitative research and interviews

### You need to be like a historian

### You need to be a good story teller
