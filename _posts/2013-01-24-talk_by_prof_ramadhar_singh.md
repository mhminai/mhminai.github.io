### Research

- Make the best use of graduate school
- Research has two objectives:
    1. Get a degree and a good job
    2. Begin enjoyment of making a contribution to knowledge
- Continue to collaborate with supervisors and peers
- Persistence is a must
- Always ask why multiple times
- Life is unkind and unfair, get over it
- If manuscript rejected, take criticism and suggestions, resend, repeat till published
    - Could be reviewer's mindset
    - Have faith in your finding
    - Important to enjoy what you do, not everything you do would be acceptable, get your work recorded whereever it succeeds
- Research is always painful
    - Enjoy inflicting pain on yourself :-)
