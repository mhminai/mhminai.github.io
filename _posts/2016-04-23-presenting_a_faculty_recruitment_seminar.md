# What is a thesis?

- Plan your thesis as a collection of 3 papers
- Never write a "thesis", write 3 papers and collect them to form a thesis
- Position your papers within the literature
    - Once you are done with your papers, go back to your literature
      review and look at how your contribution fits within the existing
      literature
- Use the "Introduction" and "Conclusion" chapters to link together your 3 papers
- The *flow* of your thesis should not be compromised

# The Presentation

- Be comfortable with failure
- Practice using dry runs preferably actual FRSs
    - Your first FRS will test you. View it as a learning experience
- Let the slides show only what you are discussing. Avoid getting
  questions on bullet 3 while talking about bullet 2
    - Unveil bullets when you get to them
- Remember you are not being judged only on your research abilities but also
  on your teaching abilities
- Need to motivate the audience to listen to the complete story, or as much as
  possible. Try to keep area specific items to a minimum and club them
  together in one place.
- Direct attention of audience with the use of animation etc.
- Write down each and every query you get. It will help you in preparing
  for future FRSs
- An FRS is not a closed book exam, take your notes, have a cue card
- Lead to the questions that you want asked
- At the end link back to the beginning. Close the loop.
