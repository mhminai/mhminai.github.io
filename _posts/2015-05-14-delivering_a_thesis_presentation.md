# Learnings from attending seminars

During seminars some questions keep cropping up repeatedly. Presenters would do well to address these queries up front. This is an ongoing collection of such queries.

- Why is there a gap?
- Definition of terms
    - Completely
    - Unambiguously
- Specific examples to support your conclusions
- What would happen in the reverse situation
- Justification of inferences, particularly for qualitative research
- Encourage questions, allow questions to complete and then answer
- Answer at least the following questions in your presentation
    - Why is your work important?
    - What is new in your work?
    - What is non-obvious or novel in your work?
- Purely qualitative research needs very solid theoretical backing
- For inferences from case studies, use external data for validation
- Get access to documents if you do qualitative research, record interviews, get them transcribed by someone other than you.
- Work like a historian
- Tell it like a good story teller
