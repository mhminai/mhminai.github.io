<div class="mobile-post">From sometime now I have been noticing that I  cannot actually set up my priorities correctly. Thus focus is missing  from my execution. I try to juggle too many balls at the same time and  end up getting all of them on the floor!</div><br /><div class="mobile-post">Some key soft skills one must be conversant with to be successful in this world are:<br />- Time management<br />- Networking<br />- Data and Information Organization<br />- Delegation (Possibly to the computer!)</div><br /><div class="mobile-post">Each of these deserves a blog of their own but I shall try to elaborate on my thoughts on these topics in later blogs.</div>
