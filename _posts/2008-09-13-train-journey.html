Shatabdi is always cool. No matter what the weather outside or which way the wind blows, I like travelling on a train with an attitude. It had been a time since I travelled on this one though. Had been flying a lot lately and man I was in for a shocker. Every third window was broken, the act of some playful but ignorant village boy. Serves the government right for leaving the kids uneducated. Well actually serves us right, beacause its our taxes that the government is misusing one way or the other.<br /><br />And man, have the people travelling on shatabdi changed or what?
