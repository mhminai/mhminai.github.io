<u><b>This post was originally on mouthshut, but then I decided to consolidate</b></u><br /><br />It is difficult to wait for your time in the sun. Odd hours and hectic  schedules are all about motion with no movement. Life goes on. <br /><br />Then once in a while someone wakes up to the craziness of it all and  decides that they have had enough. They step away. And to a better  place. For now. The wheel, however rolls on, unforgivingly. It takes no  prisoners. It spares none. A year, an eon gone by. The dreaded moment  comes again like the ticking of the seconds hand of the clock. Once more  the odd hours the hectic schedule. More motion, less movement. Life  goes on <br /><br />Then an event happens, a New Year, a birthday, a  heart attack, a loved one's death. Time stops but for a while. Life  rushes past and memories flood over. We get time to look at ourselves in  the mirror and we don't like what we see. We don't like where we are  going. We jump. Safely? Maybe with some bruises. We dust ourselves,  stand and look around. The world is a different place. It has sun rises  too! The flowers have aromas sweeter than any perfume. The colours of  the rainbow are more radiant, more deep than our 32bit reality, than our  2.5inch window to the world. We breath. Lungs fill out. For once there  is more oxygen than nicotine. And this time also, life goes on. :-) <br /><br />
