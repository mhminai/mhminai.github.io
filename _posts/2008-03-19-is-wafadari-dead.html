<br /><u><b>This post was originally on mouthshut, but I decided to consolidate</b></u><br /><br /><u>The Trigger </u><br /><br />I recently watched Jodhaa Akbar. It had various  scenes were either "wafadari" or "ghaddari" were bandied about in quite a  bit. That got me thinking. What happened to the loyalty to King and  Country that were conerstones of feudal societies not so long ago? Great  men, both militarily and otherwise were usually so only because their  followers were entirely devoted to them or to their cause and were  willing to lay down their lives for that cause. Is that sort of loyalty,  what is referred to as "wafadari" now dead? <br /><br /><br /><u> Changes </u><br /><br />Society and people have transformed quite a bit from medieval days.  Nowadays there is almost direct representation for political power and  it is not necessarily assumed that the strongest person or richest  person would be supported by everyone he has dominion over. Lineage is  no longer preeminent in making choices of leaders. Meritocracy is on the  rise, at least in developed countries. All of these factors have  enormously empowered the normal layman. He is no longer required to be  loyal to any person. He cannot be punished by anyone just because he  refuses to stand in abeyance.  <br /><br />Also a lot of individualism  has crept into humanity. It is no longer us versus them as it was when  we were supposedly cave dwellers trying to defend our weak selves from  much stronger competition. There must have been something in that system  that made it necessary for tribes to bond so closely to each other, to  survive. Nowadays that is no longer important. You are only as good as  you are. The fact that your father was a great man does not usually give  you any headstart and even if it does, the present generation doesn't  seem to like it too much! They are eager to come out of the wings of  their predecessors and make their own music. Is this why the classics of  yesteryears are no longer valued as they once were? Would it be safe to  assume that their prices are not due to an appreciation of their  intrinsic worth but a new sense of "I" own this? <br /><br /><br /><u> Militaries, Organizations and the like </u><br /><br />There are some arenas though where people to people loyalties  (volunteered or forced) still exist. Current militaries function on the  listen and obey principle. A break in the chain of command is a sure  path to being court-martialed. Insubordinacy is not tolerated even in  the most lenient of organizations unless it is for the benefit of the  organization which in the end is a profit making and taking organism  after all.  <br /><br />Maybe though loyalty towards people has ended (or  has it?), it has rather been replaced by wafadari towards "concepts and  ideas" like nationalism and dogma. I see no logical reason why I should  love the soil on one side of a border and not that on the other side  just because someone else governs there? Usually if you are close to an  national border, the soil composition, nutritional content, fertility  are more or less the same. Perhaps more so than in some remoter areas of  your own country. Yet patriotism is highly valued! Do we need to hero  worship someone or something? What of "Law"? Is that not written by a  human like you and me? Why is that a dogma? Maybe for making sense of it  all, I can just imagine the confusion arising if every Tom, Dick and  Harry decides to get up and write his own version of the constitution.  So we still need role models, people or stuff we do not question, or  question only in hushed terms. <br /><br /><br /><u> Effects </u><br /><br />Has  this limited man's ability to achieve?&nbsp;Over the past few centuries the  only thing that has remained a currency is, well, currency. No Zamindars  today have the unflinching support of the people who live off their  allocated land. No Politicians command idealist support, at least I  don't think so. I think everyone supports anyone else for some visible,  real or unreal, benefit to oneself. Oneself, mind you, not one's country  or the greater good. Has this made everyone an island and as great work  is done only by great teams, have we stopped doing great work? When was  the last time, someone like a Chengis could dream of conquering the  world and actually come close to doing it? When was the last time a Taj  Mahal was conceived and made? 22,000 labourers for 20 years! At Rs.50  per day per labour that comes out to be about Rs. 8,83,30,00,000 and  that is assuming all 22,000 were labours, no masons, no stone cutters,  no sculpters. And all for what? A garden? Was it worth it? Has anyone  since attempted it? Look at the world around you. Is there one person or  thing on the face of this earth that makes us proud to be humans?  Something that testifies to the truth of our having evolved? Are we  actually making everyone mediocre by making everyone equal? Do some  people deserve to only be menially serving other's of better merit or  race so that human race may prosper? Was it such a good idea to get rid  of "wafadari"?
