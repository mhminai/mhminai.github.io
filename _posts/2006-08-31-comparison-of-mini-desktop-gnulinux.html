<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">STILL WORK IN PROGRESS</span><br /><br />Recently  I got my hands on puppy linux and DSL and I must say they both amazed  me. In fact they looked so interesting that I decided to do a  comparative study of the "mini" linux distributions out there. Here I  shall try to summarize what I learnt.<br /><br />First, some disclaimers:<br /><ul><li>I am a relative linux newbie</li><li>My comments are going to be totally subjective</li><li>I am unassociated with either distribution (thought that might change)</li><li>Don't know ALL mini linux distributions but would love to hear more</li></ul><br />Second, my criteria<br /><ul><li>    I am considering desktop linuxes, no resuce cds, utility stuff e.t.c.</li><li>"mini"  to me means small enough to fir on a mini-cd (185MB). Though both of  these are less than 70MB, I think a distribution uptil 185MB can be  considered "mini"</li><li>The distro need not run from memory. Though  with current machines having 1GB of RAM, I see no reason why a 185MB  distro should be unable to run from memory</li></ul><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">STILL WORK IN PROGRESS</span>
