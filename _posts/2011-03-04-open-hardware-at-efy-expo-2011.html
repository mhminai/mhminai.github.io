Recently attended the Design Conference at EFY-Expo 2012 which was   held between the 17th and 19th of February at New Delhi, India. EFY and   Reed Exhibitions came together to organize the first mega electronics   exhibition for 2011 in India. You can get the full spiel from <a href="http://www.efyexpo.com/">www.efyexpo.com</a>.<br /><br />Under   the umbrella of this Expo an Embedded Design Conference was held which   had panel discussions and sessions by several industry experts from  both  the hardware and software areas.&nbsp; EFY managed to get  representation  from the entire value chain of open hardware, all the  way from IP cores  that are open source through open source tools to  develop such hardware  to opening up the repair process of hardware you  own!<br /><br />Some of the people I had a chance of  meeting were:<br /><ul><li>Massimo Banzi : Co-founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, created the first wildly popular open hardware platform</li><li>Marcus Erlandsson : CTO of OrSOC, which owns <a href="http://www.opencores.org/">www.opencores.org</a></li><li><a href="http://khasim.blogspot.com/">Syed Mohammad Khasim</a> : Core Team Member,&nbsp;<a href="http://beagleboard.org/">Beagle board</a>, a high end and yet again wildly popular open hardware platform</li><li>Shakthi Kannan : developer for &nbsp;<a href="http://spins.fedoraproject.org/fel/">FEL (Fedora Elctronic Lab)</a>, a spin of Fedora which collects all open source hardware design tools</li><li>Kyle Wiens : CEO of <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/">iFixit</a>, which is trying to add the freedom of repairing your hardware to the list of freedoms for "free hardware"</li></ul><br />They key take aways I got from the conference were:<br /><ol><li>Organizations do not add any value for IPs that are standard such as UARTs, DDR Controller's e.t.c.</li><li>Verification is taking up more and more time in the development   cycle and sharing this cost across organizations should help in driving   TTM. And in fact would be inevitable as interfaces become more and more   complex.</li><li>The licensing for open source hardware needs to permit organizations   to add their proprietary (value add) IPs to a system using open IPs   without requiring them to open source those IPs. So GPL does not work   for open hardware. Some efforts to modify open source licensing has been   done by the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/FAQ">Arduino</a> project.</li><li>Owning a product should grant you the right to repair it yourself if   need be. And open hardware helps make this possible. iFixit hopes to   become the home to repair manuals for every product on the planet,   preventing things from being thrown away.</li><li>Open hardware is truely enabled only with open tools, available to a  wide range of community. What GCC does for open software. With FEL we  have decent tools to do most development.</li><li>Products are being developed and sold based totally on open   hardware. Syed Khasim brandished a really cool tablet based entirely on   the Beagle Board Platform.</li></ol><br />FOSS (Free Open Source Software) is hugely popular,   and lots of companies have built business models around it.  To the  extent that they are able to remain profitable while sharing all  the  development they do with a much larger community. The same has not   happened, or at least on the same scale, for open hardware.<br /><br />Some challenges I think hampering open hardware adoption in general are:<br /><ol><li>Bugs   in hardware discovered after silicon is made is much more catastrophic   for hardware than for software, and having your source open makes you   that much more liable to explain every line of code if you use it in   your product</li><li>Open hardware is more expensive to use than open software. Most   people have a computer at home and can download and evaluate software   for suitability of their use. Same is not yet the case with hardware. If   I want to evaluate open hardware, I need to buy/manufacture the board   to test it on. Thus contribution and use of open hardware is  inherrently  limited by this factor.</li><li>To do anything useful with hardware you need an application and   software for that application. That is if the hardware you have designed   is generic enough. Writing software for embedded systems is a   non-trivial task. Though Arduino's IDE is I think a step in the right   direction.</li><li>If the hardware platform is too generic, it is not cost optimised   for your application and if it is not generic enough, you don't get the   benefit of scores of people validating it with you.</li></ol><br />Another concern that Massimo raised was the high   consumption and low contribution that open source hardware projects see   from emerging countries such as India. Syed Khasim responded that   engineers in India were unwilling to contribute to such projects and   risk the ire of their employers. If organizations on the other hand were   to support such initiatives, the expected contributions could increase   manifold. Further the non-prevalence of broadband widely in India was   also cited as a possible reason by Shakthi Kannan.<br /><br />Overall, the design conference did give me an entirely new perspective on the possibilities of open hardware.<br /><br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O9cC9wQaA0I/TXCV-lHw_zI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/sRqPtwwqjhk/s1600/DSC05024.JPG" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O9cC9wQaA0I/TXCV-lHw_zI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/sRqPtwwqjhk/s320/DSC05024.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">At EFY-Expo 2011</td></tr></tbody></table><br />From left to right: Rajkumar Agrawal,   Mohammad Haris Minai, Kyle Wiens,  Massimo Banzi, Shakthi Kannan, Marcus   Erlandsson, Syed Mohammed Khasim<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Other pictures are at: <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/mhminai/EFYExpo2011">https://picasaweb.google.com/mhminai/EFYExpo2011</a>
