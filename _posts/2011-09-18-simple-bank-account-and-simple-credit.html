<div>So thinking through what I would like from my "ideal" bank account and from an ideal credit card, here is the list:</div><div><br /></div><div>Bank Account:</div><ul><li>No interest (0%) (A bank is the worst saving's instrument anyway)</li><li>Less than Rs. 10,000 Average Quarterly Balance requirement</li><li>More than 5 ATM accesses permitted per month, free of charge from any ATM across the country</li><li>Payable-At-Par chequebook facility</li><li>ATM only card, no debit or shopping facility, single day withdrawal upto Rs. 25,000</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Credit Card:</div><ul><li>Reminder service; 1 week, 3 days and 1 day before my payment becomes due</li><li>A week's grace period after due date, during which if I pay the amount in full, all charges (such as late payment, interest) are reversed :-)</li><li>Credit limit hard boundary at Rs. 30,000 per month</li><li>Don't need any scheme of "cash back" or "rewards". A credit card is only for convenience never for credit</li></ul><div><br /></div><div></div><div>And seriously I think I would actually be willing to PAY for services that simple. If any of you guys know of some bank that can provide me these services please do drop me a comment.</div>
